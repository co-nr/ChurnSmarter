## Rejected 

I’ve spun the roulette wheel that is the apple review process and unfortunately got unlucky.

The fate of this app has been determined by 1 reviewer… the judge, jury and executioner.

So that's where this one ends, a project left unfinished… a story never reaching chapter 2.

##
- Your app provides financial services but does not meet all the requirements for apps providing these services.
- The account that submits the app must be enrolled in the Apple Developer Program as an organization, and not as an individual.
- These requirements give App Store users confidence that apps offering financial services are qualified to provide these services and will responsibly manage their data.
